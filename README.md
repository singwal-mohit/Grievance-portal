# Grievance-portal
 It is a web-based project for the university students
and officials as a platform to digitalise and improve the Grievance portal of
the university. Physically, it is found to be difficult to solve the queries being
faced in different students.
It mainly focuses on user experience in the project. On the internet,
everything is available but in a very unorganized manner so it will also make
it user friendly. We have used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap and Jquery
for the frontend part of the website and python based Django framework,
Django -taggit(library by Django), SQLite Database for the
backend part.
